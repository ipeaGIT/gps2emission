#' Emission factors from European Environment Agency â€” EMEP/EEA
#'
#' Hot exhaust emission factors are speed dependent functions and are expressed in g/km. 
#' It varies by fuel, vehicle segment, euro standard, pollutant, and after treatment technology. 
#' These variables are consolidated in different EF equations, given by:
#'
#' EF = EF(Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zita, Hta, RF, Speed, Function_ID, k, fcorr),
#' 
#' where Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta are constant parameters; 
#' RF is the Reduction Factor, Speed in the average speed, Function_ID is the 
#' equation (function of on the year of the inventory and the pollutant); k is 
#' a constant value, and fcorr is the fuel correction factor.
#' 
#' The emissions factors are derived from the EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook
#' (formerly called the EMEP CORINAIR emission inventory guidebook). The document provides guidance on
#' estimating emissions from both anthropogenic and natural emission sources. 
#' 
#' The package presents a combination of emission factors from EMEP/EEA guidelines of 2007,
#'  2013, 2016, and 2019, aiming to cover a greater number of pollutants and vehicle segments.
#'  The script used to process the raw EMEP/EEA databases can be found in the repository
