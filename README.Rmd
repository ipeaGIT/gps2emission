### Generating estimates of public transport emissions from GTFS data

**gtfs2emis** is an R package to estimate the emission levels of public transport networks based on GTFS data. The package combines two **inputs**: geolocated time tables of public transport services organized in GTFS format, and some basic information on fleet characteristics such as fleet age, ..... . As it stands, the **gtfs2emis** package generates estimates for several environmental pollutants (see table below) at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Pollution levels can be calculated for specific transport routes, trips, time of the day or for the transport system as a whole. These **outputs** can be extracted in different formats, supporting analysis on how emission levels vary across space, time and by fleet characteristics.

The **gtfs2emis** package leverages on standard GTFS data format and develops a computational method that can be easily used to estimate enviromental emissions of several public transport systems around the world. One of the core advantages of **gtfs2emis** is that it makes extremely easy to simulate how the environmental performance of a public transport system would change under different policy scenarios. Simple modifications to the package input would allow one to estimate how emissions levels could be affected by different interventions such as electrifying the fleet, building new transport corridors, changing route itineraries or frequencies and fleet renewal.
