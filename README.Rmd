### Generating estimates of public transport emissions from GTFS data

**gtfs2emis** is an R package to estimate the emission levels of public transport networks based on GTFS data. The package combines two **inputs**: I) geolocated time tables of public transport services organized in GTFS format; and II) information on fleet characteristics such as fleet age, technology, fuel, euro stage, speed etc. As it stands, it estimates several pollutants (see table below) at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Pollution levels can be calculated for specific transport routes, trips, time of the day or for the transport system as a whole. These **outputs** can be extracted in different formats, supporting analysis on how emission levels vary across space, time and by fleet characteristics.

<!-- The **gtfs2emis** package leverages on standard GTFS data format and develops a computational method that can be easily used to estimate enviromental emissions of several public transport systems around the world. One of the core advantages of **gtfs2emis** is that it makes extremely easy to simulate how the environmental performance of a public transport system would change under different policy scenarios. Simple modifications to the package input would allow one to estimate how emissions levels could be affected by different interventions such as electrifying the fleet, building new transport corridors, changing route itineraries or frequencies and fleet renewal. -->

### Installation

```{r installation, message = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# From CRAN
# install.packages("gtfs2emis")
# library(gtfs2emis)
# devtools::install_github("rafapereirabr/gtfs2emis",auth_token = "94c88a642a2f62fce15e4c05cc0b6ead55ff5851")
# or use the development version with latest features
# utils::remove.packages('gtfs2emis')
# devtools::install_github("ipeaGIT/gtfs2emis")
# library(gtfs2emis)
```

### Basic Usage

The package requires two fundamental datasets.

1. GTFS
 - Public transport data in the format of General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)
 
2. Fleet
 - Data frame of vehicles according to characteristics of age, technology, fuel, euro stage, category
 - Additional columns of urban bus route for specific allocation of fleet by route
 
 
## Demonstration on sample data

See detailed demonstration of `gtfs2emis` in the [intro Vignette](https://github.com/rafapereirabr/gtfs2emis/blob/master/doc/gtfs2emis-vignette.md)
To illustrate the functionality, the package includes a small sample data set of the public transport and fleet of Porto Alegre (Brazil). Three steps are required to use `gtfs2emis`, as follows.


```{r sample_vignette, message = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# load package
#   library(gtfs2emis)
# 
# # 1) Transport model
# 
# # Read GTFS
#   fort <- gtfs2gps::read_gtfs(system.file("extdata/fortaleza.zip"
#                                           , package = "gtfs2gps"))  %>%
#     gtfs2gps::filter_single_trip() %>% 
#     gtfs2gps::filter_by_shape_id(c("shape804-I", "shape806-I"))
#   
#  # GPS output
#   fort_gps <- gtfs2gps::transport_model()
#   
#   # 2) Fleet 
#   total_fleet <- data.table::data.table(year = c(2005,2010,2011,2012
#                                                  ,2014,2015,2017,2018,2019),
#                                         bus = c(1,61,50,1,45,18,62,27,31),
#                                         veh_type_euro = "Ubus Std 15 - 18 t",
#                                         euro_stage = c("II", "IV", "IV", "V"
#                                                        , "V", "V", "V", "V","V"))
#   
#   total_fleet[,fleet_composition := bus/sum(bus)]
#   
#   
#   # 3) Emission model
#   gtfs2emis::emission_model()
```


### Vehicle Emission Factors

Currently the package includes running exhaust emissions factors from Environmental Company of Sao Paulo (CETESB) — Brazil; California EMission Factor model (EMFAC2017) from California Air Resources Board — United States; MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) — United States;  European Environment Agency (EEA) — Europe.
