Description: Estimate the emission levels of public transport networks based on 
             general transit feed specification (GTFS) data.
             The package requires two main inputs: i) public transport 
             data in the GTFS standard format; and ii) some basic information on 
             fleet characteristics such as fleet age, technology, fuel and Euro 
             stage. As it stands, the the package estimates several pollutants 
             at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Pollution levels can be 
             calculated for specific transport routes, trips, time of the day or 
             for the transport system as a whole. The output with emission 
             estimates can be extracted in different formats, supporting analysis 
             on how emission levels vary across space, time and by fleet 
             characteristics.
