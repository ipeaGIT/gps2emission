Description: A bottom up model to estimate the emission levels of public 
             transport systens based on  General Transit Feed Specification 
             (GTFS) data. The package requires two main inputs: i) public 
             transport  data in the GTFS standard format; and ii) some basic 
             information on fleet characteristics such as fleet age, technology, 
             fuel and Euro stage. As it stands, the the package estimates several 
             pollutants at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Pollution 
             levels can be  calculated for specific transport routes, trips, 
             time of the day or for the transport system as a whole. The output 
             with emission estimates can be extracted in different formats, 
             supporting analysis  on how emission levels vary across space, 
             time and by fleet characteristics. A full description of the 
             gtfs2emis model is presented by Vieira, Pereira and Andrade (2022)
