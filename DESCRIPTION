Description: Estimate the emission levels of public transport networks based on General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data. 
             The package combines two inputs: I) geolocated time tables of public transport services 
             organized in GTFS format; and II) information on fleet characteristics such as fleet age,
             technology, fuel, euro stage, speed etc. As it stands, it estimates several pollutants at 
             high spatial and temporal resolutions. Pollution levels can be calculated for specific transport
             routes, trips, time of the day or for the transport system as a whole. These outputs can be extracted 
             in different formats, supporting analysis on how emission levels vary across space, time and by fleet 
             characteristics.
