	abstract = {While it is understood that cities generate the majority of carbon emissions, for most cities, towns, and rural areas around the world no carbon footprint (CF) has been estimated. The Gridded Global Model of City Footprints (GGMCF) presented here downscales national CFs into a 250 m gridded model using data on population, purchasing power, and existing subnational CF studies from the US, China, EU, and Japan. Studies have shown that CFs are highly concentrated by income, with the top decile of earners driving 30\%–45\% of emissions. Even allowing for significant modeling uncertainties, we find that emissions are similarly concentrated in a small number of cities. The highest emitting 100 urban areas (defined as contiguous population clusters) account for 18\% of the global carbon footprint. While many of the cities with the highest footprints are in countries with high carbon footprints, nearly one quarter of the top cities (41 of the top 200) are in countries with relatively low emissions. In these cities population and affluence combine to drive footprints at a scale similar to those of cities in high-income countries. We conclude that concerted action by a limited number of local governments can have a disproportionate impact on global emissions.},

	abstract = {Carbon emissions from road transport are one of the main issues related to modern transport planning. To address them adequately, the acquisition of reliable data about traffic flow is an essential prerequisite. However, the large quantity and the heterogeneity of available information often cause problems; missing or incomplete data are one of the most critical aspects. This paper discusses how technology handles imperfect information in order to obtain more accurate quantification of CO2 emissions. First, an analysis of single estimators and combination models is provided, highlighting their main characteristics. Then, the TANINO model (Tool for the Analysis of Non-conservative Carbon Emissions In TraNspOrt) is presented, jointly developed at the University of Seville and at the IUAV University of Venice. It consists of two different modules: the first is a combination model that optimizes the results of three traffic flow single estimators, while the second is a macro-model of carbon evaluation, which takes into account road infrastructure, vehicle type and traffic conditions. TANINO is then tested to calculate CO2 emissions along the ring road of the Spanish city of Seville, showing its more efficient performance, compared to the single estimators normally adopted for such aims. Transport planning can benefit from the adequate knowledge of traffic flows and related CO2 emissions, since it allows a more reliable monitoring of the progresses granted by specific carbon policies.},

Eligible patients were free of these neurological diseases, Ontario residents for 5 years or longer, and Canadian-born. We ascertained the individual's proximity to major roadways based on their residential postal-code address in 1996, 5 years before cohort inception. Incident diagnoses of dementia, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis were ascertained from provincial health administrative databases with validated algorithms. We assessed the associations between traffic proximity and incident dementia, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for individual and contextual factors such as diabetes, brain injury, and neighbourhood income. We did various sensitivity analyses, such as adjusting for access to neurologists and exposure to selected air pollutants, and restricting to never movers and urban dwellers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Between 2001, and 2012, we identified 243 611 incident cases of dementia, 31 577 cases of Parkinson's disease, and 9247 cases of multiple sclerosis.

We provide evidence that the effect of air pollution on verbal tests becomes more pronounced as people age, especially for men and the less educated. The damage on the aging brain by air pollution likely imposes substantial health and economic costs, considering that cognitive functioning is critical for the elderly for both running daily errands and making high-stake decisions.},

This estimate is derived from quasiexperimental variation in PM10 generated by China’s Huai River Policy, which provides free or heavily subsidized coal for indoor heating during the winter to cities north of the Huai River but not to those to the south. The findings are derived from a regression discontinuity design based on distance from the Huai River, and they are robust to using parametric and nonparametric estimation methods, different kernel types and bandwidth sizes, and adjustment for a rich set of demographic and behavioral covariates. Furthermore, the shorter lifespans are almost entirely caused by elevated rates of cardiorespiratory mortality, suggesting that PM10 is the causal factor. The estimates imply that bringing all of China into compliance with its Class I standards for PM10 would save 3.7 billion life-years.},

	abstract = {Exposure to ambient fine particular matter (PM2.5) was responsible for 3.2 million premature deaths in 2010 and is among the top ten leading risk factors for early death. Surface transportation is a significant global source of PM2.5 emissions and a target for new actions. The objective of this study is to estimate the global and national health burden of ambient PM2.5 exposure attributable to surface transportation emissions. This share of health burden is called the transportation attributable fraction (TAF), and is assumed equal to the proportional decrease in modeled ambient particulate matter concentrations when surface transportation emissions are removed. National population-weighted TAFs for 190 countries are modeled for 2005 using the MOZART-4 global chemical transport model. Changes in annual average concentration of PM2.5 at 0.5 × 0.67 degree horizontal resolution are based on a global emissions inventory and removal of all surface transportation emissions. Global population-weighted average TAF was 8.5 percent or 1.75 μg m−3 in 2005. Approximately 242 000 annual premature deaths were attributable to surface transportation emissions, dominated by China, the United States, the European Union and India. This application of TAF allows future Global Burden of Disease studies to estimate the sector-specific burden of ambient PM2.5 exposure. Additional research is needed to capture intraurban variations in emissions and exposure, and to broaden the range of health effects considered, including the effects of other pollutants.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Summary{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Significant global health challenges are being confronted in the 21st century, prompting calls to rethink approaches to disease prevention. A key part of the solution is city planning that reduces non-communicable diseases and road trauma while also managing rapid urbanisation. This Series of papers considers the health impacts of city planning through transport mode choices. In this, the first paper, we identify eight integrated regional and local interventions that, when combined, encourage walking, cycling, and public transport use, while reducing private motor vehicle use. These interventions are destination accessibility, equitable distribution of employment across cities, managing demand by reducing the availability and increasing the cost of parking, designing pedestrian-friendly and cycling-friendly movement networks, achieving optimum levels of residential density, reducing distance to public transport, and enhancing the desirability of active travel modes (eg, creating safe attractive neighbourhoods and safe, affordable, and convenient public transport). Together, these interventions will create healthier and more sustainable compact cities that reduce the environmental, social, and behavioural risk factors that affect lifestyle choices, levels of traffic, environmental pollution, noise, and crime. The health sector, including health ministers, must lead in advocating for integrated multisector city planning that prioritises health, sustainability, and liveability outcomes, particularly in rapidly changing low-income and middle-income countries. We recommend establishing a set of indicators to benchmark and monitor progress towards achievement of more compact cities that promote health and reduce health inequities.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This paper assesses the effect of short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution on human cognitive performance via a double cross over experimental design. Two distinct experiments were performed, both of which exposed subjects to low and high concentrations of PM. Firstly, subjects completed a series of cognitive tests after being exposed to low ambient indoor PM concentrations and elevated PM concentrations generated via candle burning, which is a well-known source of PM. Secondly, a different cohort underwent cognitive tests after being exposed to low ambient indoor PM concentrations and elevated ambient outdoor PM concentrations via commuting on or next to roads. Three tests were used to assess cognitive performance: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Stroop Color and Word test, and Ruff 2 \& 7 test. The results from the MMSE test showed a statistically robust decline in cognitive function after exposure to both the candle burning and outdoor commuting compared to ambient indoor conditions. The similarity in the results between the two experiments suggests that PM exposure is the cause of the short-term cognitive decline observed in both. The outdoor commuting experiment also showed a statistically significant short-term cognitive decline in automatic detection speed from the Ruff 2 and 7 selective attention test. The other cognitive tests, for both the candle and commuting experiments, showed no statistically significant difference between the high and low PM exposure conditions. The findings from this study are potentially far reaching; they suggest that elevated PM pollution levels significantly affect short term cognition. This implies average human cognitive ability will vary from city to city and country to country as a function of PM air pollution exposure.},

Aerosol optical depth from multiple satellite products (MISR, MODIS Dark Target, MODIS and SeaWiFS Deep Blue, and MODIS MAIAC) was combined with simulation (GEOS-Chem) based upon their relative uncertainties as determined using ground-based sun photometer (AERONET) observations for 1998–2014. The GWR predictors included simulated aerosol composition and land use information. The resultant PM2.5 estimates were highly consistent (R2 = 0.81) with out-of-sample cross-validated PM2.5 concentrations from monitors. The global population-weighted annual average PM2.5 concentrations were 3-fold higher than the 10 μg/m3 WHO guideline, driven by exposures in Asian and African regions. Estimates in regions with high contributions from mineral dust were associated with higher uncertainty, resulting from both sparse ground-based monitoring, and challenging conditions for retrieval and simulation. This approach demonstrates that the addition of even sparse ground-based measurements to more globally continuous PM2.5 data sources can yield valuable improvements to PM2.5 characterization on a global scale.},

	abstract = {The development of accurate emission inventories at an urban scale is of utmost importance for cities in light of climate change commitments and the need to identify the emission reduction potential of various strategies. Emission inventories for on-road transportation are sensitive to the network models used to generate traffic activity data. For large networks (cities or regions), average-speed models have been relied upon extensively in research and practice, primarily due to their computational attractiveness. Nevertheless, these models are myopic to traffic states and driving cycles and therefore lack in accuracy. The aim of this study is to improve the quality of regional on-road emission inventories without resorting to computationally-intensive traffic microsimulation of an entire region. For this purpose, macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic emission models are applied and compared, using average speed, average speed and its standard deviation, and instantaneous speeds. We also propose a hybrid approach called the CLustEr-based Validated Emission Re-calculation (CLEVER), which bridges between the microscopic and mesoscopic approaches. CLEVER defines unsupervised traffic conditions using a combination of mesoscopic traffic characteristics for selected road segments, and identifies a representative emission factor (EF) for each condition based on the microscopic driving cycle of the sample. Regional emissions can then be estimated by classifying segments in the regional network into these conditions, and applying corresponding EFs. The results of the CLEVER method are compared with the results of microsimulation and of mesoscopic approaches revealing a robust methodology that improves the emission inventory while reducing computational burden.},

	abstract = {The Utah Transit Authority (UTA) serves Utah’s Wasatch Front, a rapidly growing conurbation with a current population of ∼1.8 M people. UTA uses an electronic fare collection (EFC) system that requires riders to tap on as they enter a bus or train and tap off as they exit, as well as an automated passenger counter (APC) system that counts interruptions of infrared beams across vehicle doorways as riders board and alight. We analyzed EFC and APC data for 2016, along with service schedules and routes from General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, to estimate the impact of UTA on the air quality in its service region by accounting for vehicle miles traveled, gasoline gallons equivalent of fuel consumed, and multiple pollutant species emitted. Buses, light rail, and commuter rail were found to collectively offset approximately 1.5\% of the onroad emissions from the counties served by UTA due to transit use replacing single passenger vehicle use. These offsets are not homogeneous; ridership drops significantly (∼20\%–50\% depending on the mode) during the summer months as some of the largest users are educational institutions with noticeable seasonal cycles. Low transit use during the weekend negates some of the air quality benefits as buses and trains travel at lower capacity. Central routes, particularly during peak travel hours provide noticeable congestion, fuel consumption, and pollutant emissions reduction due to trips taken by transit replacing personal vehicles but off-peak, and non-central routes, show lower benefits. Because the light rail is electric, its local air quality benefits are significant due to the electricity being produced primarily outside the airshed. Upgrading the bus fleet to 2010 model, and newer, diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG) buses, as well as modeling an envisioned change to Tier 3 locomotives for the commuter rail system, was found to significantly reduce regional nitrogen oxides (NOx), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and sulfur oxides (SOx) emissions.},

We incorporate travel time elasticities into the optimization to account for demand shifts from transit to cars, resulting from increases in transit travel time. We find that emissions reductions are moderated, but not eliminated, for relatively inelastic users. We consider two scenarios: the first is where only the agency faces an emissions budget; the second is where the entire city faces an emissions budget. In the latter scenario, the emissions reductions resulting from reductions in transit level of service are mitigated as users switch to automobile.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates transit bus emissions in the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, by linking the results of a microsimulation transit assignment model, MILATRAS (microsimulation learning-based approach to transit assignment), with emission factors derived from Mobile6.2C. Emissions were estimated at the level of individual buses during idling conditions at bus stops and on roadway links between stops during the morning peak period. The busiest routes were associated with the highest total emissions as a result of a combination of high ridership and lower speeds; this association confirmed the common wisdom that newer, low-emitting buses should be first allocated to these routes. The highest dwell emissions occurred at intermodal transfer stations (bus to subway and vice versa). On a passenger kilometer basis, the highest-emitting routes were not the busiest, but rather were those with the lowest ridership. In fact, the highest emissions per passenger kilometer were associated with the Airport Rocket, a route that provided service to the airport and was characterized by low ridership in the morning peak period. On average, bus trips in Toronto were about three times more fuel efficient than were private car trips and created 20 times less carbon monoxide pollution. The effects of changing fuel types and fleet age on transit bus emissions were assessed. Implications for bus operations are discussed relative to fleet allocation to minimize total emissions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent systematic review and meta-analyses have tried to identify an association between PM2.5 exposure and stroke, but few could find a conclusive and comprehensive evidence. Moreover, the associations between PM2.5, neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders have never been reviewed. We aimed to assess the effects of PM2.5 exposure on stroke, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Parkinson's disease, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: We searched PubMed and CNKI databases for articles published until June 2018. Studies were eligible for analysis if they were human studies and provided risk estimates with 95\% CI. We screened 1645 articles and identified 80 eligible studies covering 26 countries across all continents except Antarctica. Risks of incidence and mortality were extracted and stratified by types of neurological disorders, PM2.5 concentration and duration of PM2.5 exposure.
RESULTS: We found significant association between PM2.5 exposure and stroke, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, ASD, Parkinson's disease. The risks of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke were higher than that of stroke in general, and that hemorrhagic stroke had by far the highest mortality. The risk of stroke for heavily polluted countries was significantly higher than that of lightly polluted countries. Short- and long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased risks of stroke (short-term odds ratio 1.01 [per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentrations], 95\% CI 1.01-1.02; long-term 1.14, 95\% CI 1.08-1.21) and mortality (short-term 1.02, 95\% CI 1.01-1.04; long-term 1.15, 95\% CI 1.07-1.24) of stroke. Long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased risks of dementia (1.16, 95\% CI 1.07-1.26), Alzheimer's disease (3.26, 95\% 0.84-12.74), ASD (1.68, 95\% CI 1.20-2.34), and Parkinson's disease (1.34, 95\% CI 1.04-1.73).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong association between PM2.5 exposure and neurological disorders. National governments should exert greater efforts to improve air quality given its health implications.},

	abstract = {Road transport is often the main source of air pollution in urban areas, and there is an increasing need to estimate its contribution precisely so that pollution-reduction measures (e.g. emission standards, scrapage programs, traffic management, ITS) are designed and implemented appropriately. This paper presents a meta-analysis of 50 studies dealing with the validation of various types of traffic emission model, including ‘average speed’, ‘traffic situation’, ‘traffic variable’, ‘cycle variable’, and ‘modal’ models. The validation studies employ measurements in tunnels, ambient concentration measurements, remote sensing, laboratory tests, and mass-balance techniques. One major finding of the analysis is that several models are only partially validated or not validated at all. The mean prediction errors are generally within a factor of 1.3 of the observed values for CO2, within a factor of 2 for HC and NOx, and within a factor of 3 for CO and PM, although differences as high as a factor of 5 have been reported. A positive mean prediction error for NOx (i.e. overestimation) was established for all model types and practically all validation techniques. In the case of HC, model predictions have been moving from underestimation to overestimation since the 1980s. The large prediction error for PM may be associated with different PM definitions between models and observations (e.g. size, measurement principle, exhaust/non-exhaust contribution). Statistical analyses show that the mean prediction error is generally not significantly different (p{\textless}0.05) when the data are categorised according to model type or validation technique. Thus, there is no conclusive evidence that demonstrates that more complex models systematically perform better in terms of prediction error than less complex models. In fact, less complex models appear to perform better for PM. Moreover, the choice of validation technique does not systematically affect the result, with the exception of a CO underprediction when the validation is based on ambient concentration measurements and inverse modelling. The analysis identified two vital elements currently lacking in traffic emissions modelling: 1) guidance on the allowable error margins for different applications/scales, and 2) estimates of prediction errors. It is recommended that current and future emission models incorporate the capability to quantify prediction errors, and that clear guidelines are developed internationally with respect to expected accuracy.},

	abstract = {Over 50\% of new refuse truck sales have been compressed natural gas (CNG). Compared to diesel, CNG is less expensive on diesel gallon equivalent (dge) basis. This study quantifies the real-world fuel use and tailpipe exhaust emissions from three front- and three side-loader refuse trucks, each with a spark ignition CNG engine, three-way catalyst, and similar gross weight. Measurements were made at 1 Hz using a portable emissions measurement system (PEMS). Inter-cycle and inter-vehicle variability is quantified. Effect of vehicle weight was analyzed and comparisons were made with MOVES predicted cycle average emission rates. In total, about 220,000 s of data covering 490 miles of operation were recorded. The average fuel economy was 1.9 miles per dge. On average the trucks spent 53\% of time in idle, which includes trash collection activity. The average speeds were 10 mph and 5 mph, for front- and side-loader trucks, respectively. Overall, compared to side-loader trucks, front-loader trucks had 55\% better fuel economy and 60\% lower emission rates. Compared to diesel trucks, CNG truck cycle average NOx and PM emission rates, at 1.2 g/mile and 0.006 g/mile respectively, were substantially lower while CO and HC rates, at 29 g/mile and 6 g/mile respectively, were considerably higher. Fuel use and CO2 emissions rates increased by 10\% due to increase in truck weight during trash collection, while CO emissions rates increased by up to 30\%. Compared to measured values, MOVES estimated cycle average fuel use and CO2 emissions were 25\% lower, CO emissions are 70\% lower, and NOx emissions were 200\% higher. Results from this study can be used to improve solid waste life cycle and tailpipe emission factor models and, when combined with previous studies on diesel refuse trucks, evaluate the effect on fuel use and emissions from adoption of CNG refuse trucks.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) is required by the EPA to replace Mobile 6 as an official on-road emission model. Incorporated with annual vehicle mile traveled (VMT) by Highways Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) vehicle class, MOVES allocates VMT from HPMS to MOVES source (vehicle) types and calculates emission burden by MOVES source type. However, the calculated running emission burden by MOVES source type may be deviated from the actual emission burden because of MOVES source population, specifically the population fraction by MOVES source type in HPMS vehicle class. The deviation is also the result of the use of the universal set of parameters, i.e., relative mileage accumulation rate (relativeMAR), packaged in MOVES default database. This paper presents a novel approach by adjusting the relativeMAR to eliminate the impact of MOVES source population on running exhaust emission and to keep start and evaporative emissions unchanged for both MOVES2010b and MOVES2014. Results from MOVES runs using this approach indicated significant improvements on VMT distribution and emission burden estimation for each MOVES source type. The deviation of VMT by MOVES source type is minimized by using this approach from 12\% to less than 0.05\% for MOVES2010b and from 50\% to less than 0.2\% for MOVES2014 except for MOVES source type 53. Source type 53 still remains about 30\% variation. The improvement of VMT distribution results in the elimination of emission burden deviation for each MOVES source type. For MOVES2010b, the deviation of emission burdens decreases from −12\% for particulate matter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and −9\% for carbon monoxide (CO) to less than 0.002\%. For MOVES2014, it drops from 80\% for CO and 97\% for PM2.5 to 0.006\%.Implications: This approach is developed to more accurately estimate the total emission burdens using EPA’s MOVES, both MOVES2010b and MOVES2014, by redistributing vehicle mile traveled (VMT) by Highways Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) class to MOVES source type on the basis of comprehensive traffic study, local link-by-link VMT broken down into MOVES source type.},

Testing was performed under real-traffic conditions in Madrid, Spain, using a portable emission measurement system (PEMS). The PEMS data also were combined with the vehicle specific power (VSP) methodology to analyse the differences between the performance of the two types of buses and develop an energy-based emission model. Between the empty and 4000 kg passenger load cases, the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for the diesel bus showed a significant increase by approximately 25\%. With an increase in the road grade, and congestion level, the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of both types of buses increased, by 6–55\%. Unlike in the case of the diesel bus, the NOx emissions of the CNG bus decreased by 40–50\% as the level of road grade and congestion increased. At intervals of VSP ≥ 2 kW/t, NOx emission rates for the CNG bus were approximately 60\% lower than those of the diesel bus. Finally, the proposed VSP-based model estimated the fuel consumption and the CO2 and NOx emission factors with relative total errors of less than 13\%.},

Whether PM2.5 levels below current US National Ambient Air Quality Standards also increase the risk of ischemic stroke remains uncertain.We reviewed the medical records of 1705 Boston area patients hospitalized with neurologist-confirmed ischemic stroke and abstracted data on the time of symptom onset and clinical characteristics. The PM2.5 concentrations were measured at a central monitoring station. We used the time-stratified case-crossover study design to assess the association between the risk of ischemic stroke onset and PM2.5 levels in the hours and days preceding each event. We examined whether the association with PM2.5 levels differed by presumed ischemic stroke pathophysiologic mechanism and patient characteristics.The estimated odds ratio (OR) of ischemic stroke onset was 1.34 (95\% CI, 1.13-1.58) (P \&lt; .001) following a 24-hour period classified as moderate (PM2.5 15-40 μg/m3) by the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Air Quality Index compared with a 24-hour period classified as good (≤15 μg/m3). Considering PM2.5 levels as a continuous variable, we found the estimated odds ratio of ischemic stroke onset to be 1.11 (95\% CI, 1.03-1.20) (P = .006) per interquartile range increase in PM2.5 levels (6.4 μg/m3). The increase in risk was greatest within 12 to 14 hours of exposure to PM2.5 and was most strongly associated with markers of traffic-related pollution.These results suggest that exposure to PM2.5 levels considered generally safe by the US EPA increase the risk of ischemic stroke onset within hours of exposure.},

On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM {\textless}2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease–related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM2.5 exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart Association scientific statement was published. Finally, PM2.5 exposure is deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.},

	abstract = {Air pollution affects 90\% of the world's population and has caused 9 million deaths in 2015, becoming the most important cause of premature deaths in the world. Exposure to fine particulate matter, a major component of urban air pollution, has been associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk and associated mortality. Impact of fine particles on the cardiovascular system includes inflammation, activation of prothrombotic pathways, oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction and remodeling, and neurological dysfunction. Genetic and epigenetic factors might also increase the susceptibility to air pollution. Consequently, epidemiologic studies have identified correlations between air particulate matter concentrations and acute coronary events, ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute heart failure, and stroke. Interestingly, these effects are present even for fine particulate matter concentrations below current US and EU regulatory standards, and seems to be more harmful in the most fragile population such as low-income or elderly subjects, or patients with previous cardiovascular disease. This review aims to summarize recent data on the pathophysiology and epidemiology of cardiovascular disease after particulate matter exposure. It will also discuss potential strategies to reduce the impact of air pollution on current and future populations' health.},

In order to investigate the responses of children of different ages to air pollution exposure, daily records of hospital admissions for children in five age groups (equal or less than 2 years of age, 3-5, 6-13, 14-19, and all ages together, i.e., from 0-19 years of age) were obtained from January 1993 to November 1997 in São Paulo, Brazil, and were compared to daily records of PM10, O3, SO2, CO and NO2 concentrations in ambient air. For each age group a generalized additive Poisson regression was fitted controlling for smooth functions of time, temperature, humidity, and days of the week, with an additional indicator for holidays. Polynomial distributed lag models were used to estimate the 7-day cumulative effect of each pollutant. Children 2 years or less were the most susceptible to the effects of all five pollutants with an increase of 9.4\% (95\% CI: 7.9,10.9) in respiratory admissions associated with each interquartile range increase in PM10. The oldest group was the second most susceptible to air pollutants, with each interquartile range increase in PM10 associated with a 5.1\% (95\% CI: 0.3,9.8) increase in respiratory admissions. An interquartile range increase in CO was associated with an 11.3\% (95\% CI: 5.9,16.8) increase in respiratory hospitalizations. When a multipollutant model was used, the effect of PM10 on respiratory admissions for all ages together was unchanged, while the SO2 and the other pollutants effect was substantially reduced. This study showed that daily respiratory hospital admissions for children and adolescents in São Paulo increased with air pollution, and that the largest effects were found for the youngest (2 years or less) and oldest (14-19 years) age groups.},

	abstract = {Combustion emissions adversely impact air quality and human health. A multiscale air quality model is applied to assess the health impacts of major emissions sectors in United States. Emissions are classified according to six different sources: electric power generation, industry, commercial and residential sources, road transportation, marine transportation and rail transportation. Epidemiological evidence is used to relate long-term population exposure to sector-induced changes in the concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone to incidences of premature death. Total combustion emissions in the U.S. account for about 200,000 (90\% CI: 90,000–362,000) premature deaths per year in the U.S. due to changes in PM2.5 concentrations, and about 10,000 (90\% CI: −1000 to 21,000) deaths due to changes in ozone concentrations. The largest contributors for both pollutant-related mortalities are road transportation, causing ∼53,000 (90\% CI: 24,000–95,000) PM2.5-related deaths and ∼5000 (90\% CI: −900 to 11,000) ozone-related early deaths per year, and power generation, causing ∼52,000 (90\% CI: 23,000–94,000) PM2.5-related and ∼2000 (90\% CI: −300 to 4000) ozone-related premature mortalities per year. Industrial emissions contribute to ∼41,000 (90\% CI: 18,000–74,000) early deaths from PM2.5 and ∼2000 (90\% CI: 0–4000) early deaths from ozone. The results are indicative of the extent to which policy measures could be undertaken in order to mitigate the impact of specific emissions from different sectors — in particular black carbon emissions from road transportation and sulfur dioxide emissions from power generation.},

For the first time, on-bicycle air pollution concentrations were assessed along this lane using black carbon (BC) as an indicator of fossil fuel combustion. We measured BC concentrations with a hand-held microaethalometer at a high temporal resolution, enabling the capture of fine spatial gradients along the route. Although this new link expanded the city's cycling network, our pioneering study showed that BC concentrations were large (mean 8.5 μg m-3) with extreme values reaching 24.0 μg m-3, comparable to concentrations found in many megacities. In agreement with other studies, we observed that concentrations decreased about 1.6 times on a section of the bicycle lane running through a calmer neighbourhood, which could indicate the potential to safeguard the health of cyclists by installing lanes with greater separation from main roads, such as Paulista Avenue. This pilot work paves the way to more detailed studies aiming to map out the spatial distribution of other traffic-related pollutants across the city's 458-km long bicycle network.},

Our approach employs Census demographic data and a recently published high-resolution dataset of outdoor NO2 concentrations. Nationally, population-weighted mean NO2 concentrations are 4.6 ppb (38\%, p{\textless}0.01) higher for nonwhites than for whites. The environmental health implications of that concentration disparity are compelling. For example, we estimate that reducing nonwhites’ NO2 concentrations to levels experienced by whites would reduce Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) mortality by ∼7,000 deaths per year, which is equivalent to 16 million people increasing their physical activity level from inactive (0 hours/week of physical activity) to sufficiently active ({\textgreater}2.5 hours/week of physical activity). Inequality for NO2 concentration is greater than inequality for income (Atkinson Index: 0.11 versus 0.08). Low-income nonwhite young children and elderly people are disproportionately exposed to residential outdoor NO2. Our findings establish a national context for previous work that has documented air pollution environmental injustice and inequality within individual US metropolitan areas and regions. Results given here can aid policy-makers in identifying locations with high environmental injustice and inequality. For example, states with both high injustice and high inequality (top quintile) for outdoor residential NO2 include New York, Michigan, and Wisconsin.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Tropospheric ozone (O3) is potentially associated with cardiovascular disease risk and premature death. Results from long-term epidemiological studies on O3 are scarce and inconclusive.

Objectives: In this study, we examined associations between chronic ambient O3 exposure and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a large cohort of U.S. adults.

Methods: Cancer Prevention Study II participants were enrolled in 1982. A total of 669,046 participants were analyzed, among whom 237,201 deaths occurred through 2004. We obtained estimates of O3 concentrations at the participant’s residence from a hierarchical Bayesian space–time model. Estimates of fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of up to 2.5 μm [PM2.5]) and NO2 concentrations were obtained from land use regression. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine mortality associations adjusted for individual- and ecological-level covariates.

Measurements and Main Results: In single-pollutant models, we observed significant positive associations between O3, PM2.5, and NO2 concentrations and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. In two-pollutant models adjusted for PM2.5, significant positive associations remained between O3 and all-cause (hazard ratio [HR] per 10 ppb, 1.02; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.01–1.04), circulatory (HR, 1.03; 95\% CI, 1.01–1.05), and respiratory mortality (HR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.08–1.16) that were unchanged with further adjustment for NO2. We also observed positive mortality associations with both PM2.5 (both near source and regional) and NO2 in multipollutant models.

Conclusions: Findings derived from this large-scale prospective study suggest that long-term ambient O3 contributes to risk of respiratory and circulatory mortality. Substantial health and environmental benefits may be achieved by implementing further measures aimed at controlling O3 concentrations.},

The emission measurement techniques covered include those most widely used for road vehicle emissions data collection, namely chassis and engine dynamometer measurements, remote sensing, road tunnel studies and portable emission measurements systems (PEMS). The main advantages and disadvantages of each method with regards to emissions modelling are presented. A review of the ways in which EFs may be derived from test data is also performed, with a clear distinction between data obtained under controlled conditions (engine and chassis dynamometer measurements using standard driving cycles) and measurements under real-world operation.},

The PEMS data also were combined with the vehicle specific power (VSP) methodology to analyse the differences between the performance of the two types of buses and develop an energy-based emission model. Between the empty and 4000 kg passenger load cases, the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for the diesel bus showed a significant increase by approximately 25\%. With an increase in the road grade, and congestion level, the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of both types of buses increased, by 6–55\%. Unlike in the case of the diesel bus, the NOx emissions of the CNG bus decreased by 40–50\% as the level of road grade and congestion increased. At intervals of VSP ≥ 2 kW/t, NOx emission rates for the CNG bus were approximately 60\% lower than those of the diesel bus. Finally, the proposed VSP-based model estimated the fuel consumption and the CO2 and NOx emission factors with relative total errors of less than 13\%.},

	abstract = {Bus emissions have become one of the important contributing factors in urban environmental pollution due to the frequent use of heavy-duty diesel engines in the day-time. Local bus driving cycles have a significant influence on bus emissions under the different traffic conditions. This study investigated the operation mode distributions and emission characteristics for urban buses based on localized MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) using sparse Global Position System (GPS) data in Shanghai, China. Sparse GPS data from forty-three buses were prepared, and then bus trajectories were reconstructed to calculate local bus driving cycles, including model description, model calibration, and trajectory reconstruction. MOVES localization was conducted for emission estimation mainly focusing on the bus emission inventory comparison between US and China. Bus emission factors were estimated based on the localized MOVES from the aspect of different driving conditions. Results show that with the increase in average traveling speed, the proportion of idling operation mode showed a decreasing trend. Four typical vehicle operation mode distributions were identified with different average speeds to show the impact of traffic conditions. Bus emission factors first rapidly decreased and then slowly declined towards some minimum values. Bus lanes exhibited emission reduction benefits under serious traffic congestion. The findings of this study have great importance for transportation operation management and policy-making to reduce bus emissions, as well as improving air quality.},
