\section{Introduction}

Transport emissions have been widely recognized among the leading and
growing contributors to global emissions \citep[
]{caiazzo_air_2013, nocera_assessing_2018}. There is also scant evidence
of how transportation activities impact air quality in cities
\citep{landrigan_lancet_2018}, aggravating the negative short- and
long-term effects pollution has on children premature deaths
\citep{currie_traffic_2009}, cardiovascular diseases
\citep{brook_particulate_2010, turner_long-term_2016}, ischemic stroke
\citep{wellenius_ambient_2012} and cognitive development
\citep{chen_living_2017, fu_association_2019, shehab_effects_2019, zhang_impact_2018}.
This has a higher impact in low and middle-income countries
\citep{combes_fine_2019}, especially in more vulnerable groups, such as
elderly people \citep{yap_particulate_2019} and children
\citep{braga_health_2001, gauderman_association_2015}. Understanding the
spatial and temporal patterns of emissions is a key factor to adopt more
precise public policies to reduce air pollution exposure
\citep{clark_national_2014, targino_spatial_2018}, improve the housing
and land use planning, and subsidize public investments Particularly
with public transport policies, extensive efforts have been made to
quantify air pollution patterns and to understand the impact of fleet
technology, fuel, topography, and route choices on overall levels of air
pollution (refs).

Most of the studies on public transportation emissions focus on
emissions monitoring with remote sensing devices (refs), onboard
diagnosis using PEMS (refs), vehicle counts data (refs), radar
equipments (refs), public transport GPS data (refs), and fuel based
estimates (top down approaches). However, due to a restriction of
spatial application, or costly local data collection, some of these
approaches might not be easy to scale for other cities. Other
approaches, such as air quality analysis (refs), satellite data
observations (refs) would represent the final state of air quality but
ultimately do not look only at bus emissions. Studies that identify and
map pollution in low and middle-income countries are still needed,
particularly when easily reproduced.

Our analysis contributes to the public transport emission literature by
developing a novel methodology that leverages a widespread open data
format for public transport networks known as General Transit Feed
Specification (GTFS) to estimate vehicle emissions in a high spatial and
temporal resolution. The method is presented in a R package
``gtfs2emis'' to allow friendly and reproducible use for different
applications. In this paper, we present estimates on CO2, NOx, PM10, CO,
CH4 hot exhaust emissions for 24 cities in the world, considering a
typical business day on October 2019 --- as a baseline date. A
comparison of the vehicle emissions rates of those transport networks is
also presented, along with a discussion on the versatility and
limitations of the method.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section two
presents a brief literature review on public transportation emissions.
Section three describes the data and methods for the public transport
data, emission factors databases and vehicle emissions estimates..
Section four presents the results, looking at the overall levels of
pollutant emissions and its spatial and temporal resolution behavior.
Finally, section five presents the final remarks and discusses some
environmental insights that can be drawn from the package.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Transport model}

\subsubsection{GTFS data}

The method used in the paper leverages a global standard format for
public transport data known as General Transit Feed Specification
(GTFS). The GTFS data of a given public transport system is collected in
a ZIP file, that brings detailed geolocated information on scheduled
services including its stops, routes, trips, stop times and calendar
organized in a structured text file.

This format was originally created in the mid-2000s by Google and
Portland transport authority and it has since then become adopted
worldwide by more than 600 cities
\citep{noauthor_openmobilitydata_nodate}. The simplicity of this data
format and its wide adoption creates a common ground for researchers and
practitioners across the globe to develop and share computational
methods that can be seamlessly deployed across multiple cities to manage
fleet allocation, plan transport services, etc. Detailed aspects of the
GTFS contents are found in \citep{noauthor_reference_nodate}.

We expand the sample of cities with GTFS data collected directly from
local transport authorities and from Transit Feed archives - the largest
GTFS open data repository website. The GTFS data were pre-processed to
filter by bus routes and to check consistencies on the required files
(e.g.~agency, stops, routes, trips, stop times). The months of October
and November 2019 are used as the baseline date for the emissions
estimates, in order to avoid possible differences in public
transportation schedules due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A summary of the
main GTFS information is described in Table 1, together with the fleet
data.

\subsection{GTFS2gps}

The process to convert GTFS files to GPS-like spatial data points is
done for every trip of the schedule. It interpolates the space-time
position of each vehicle in each trip considering the network distance
and average speed between stops. It samples the timestamp of each
vehicle every 50m.

Once a GPS data format is generated from GTFS, a few adjustments on
speed is made. Since the mean speed is estimated in a street link
between two bus stops (e.g.~stop ``i'' and ``i+1''), the data on
departure time of ``i'' and arrival time of ``i+1'' is necessary. If
``i+1'' arrival time is very close or the same as the departure time of
``i'', the speed will be very high (\textgreater100 kph) or infinite. In
such cases, we consider the speed to be the mean speed of all the trips
in this specific bus route. Therefore, the departure times of the GPS
are recalculated based on the new travelled speeds. This adjustment is
also necessary in street links without valid arrival or departure times:
before the first bus stop of the route (where only arrival time is
available); after the last bus stop (only departure time is available);
and trips with invalid stop times.

\subsection{Emission model}

\subsubsection{Emission factors}

Emission factors (EFs) are empirical functional relations between
pollutant emissions and the activity that causes them (Franco et al.,
2013). This study uses EF based on Environmental Sanitation Technology
Company (CETESB) --- for Brazil; California Air Resources Board (CARB)
--- for the California U.S; Motor Vehicle Emission Model (MOVES) for
regions in U.S. outside California; European Environment Agency (EEA)
--- for European countries. Among these sources, EMFAC, MOVES and
EMEP/EEA have speed-dependent emission factors. For the Brazilian
cities' estimates, the local EF is scaled to the EMEP/EEA function
considering the average speed of the vehicle driving cycle. The
brazilian emission factor is related to speed by the expression

\begin{equation}
EF^{scaled}_{i,j,k,l}=EF^{local}_{i,j,k,l}\frac{EF(V_i)_{j,k,l}}{EF(V_{dc})_{j,k,l}}.  
\end{equation}

where \(EF_{i,j,k,l}^{scaled}\) is the scaled emission factors for each
street link \(i\), bus type \(j\), fuel \(k\), age \(l\),;
\(EF_{i,j,k,l}^{local}\) is the local emission factor;
\(EF(V_i)_{j,k,m}\) and \(EF(V_{dc})_{j,k,l}\) is the EEA emission
factor at the speed of \(V_i\);and the driving cycle \(V_{dc}\) of
FTP-25 (33 kph).

The CARB's (California Air Resources Board) EMFAC (EMission FACtor)
model estimates statewide and regional emissions inventory by
multiplying emissions rates with vehicle activity data. The running
exhaust emission factors are distributed according to speed bins from 5
to 90, with 5 mph incremental. It allows modeling one season (summer,
winter or annual average) due to temporal variations of EF due to
meteorological conditions (temperature and relative humidity); and
geographic area (Statewide, Air Basin, Air District, Metropolitan
Planning Organization, Country and Sub-Area). Detailed data on emission
factors are found in \citet{noauthor_emfac_nodate}.

The Motor Vehicle Emission Simular (MOVES) is a set of tools for
modelling air pollution emissions generated by onroad and nonroad
mobiles sources. It has been the official model for transportation
conformity analysis outside California state. The MOVES database of
emission rates are stored according to pollutant, emission process (
e.g.~running exhaust, start exhaust, extended idle), fuel type,
regulatory class, model year, operation mode and vehicle age. Urban
buses are classified into fuel type (CNG, Diesel, Gasoline), age, speed
range, pollutant, and source type. Detailed discussion on heavy-duty
emission rates are found in {[}EPA-HDV-MANUAL{]}.

European exhaust emission factors are presented in the EMEP/EEA air
pollutant inventory guidebook, considering the COPERT 5.4 Software
version. This study considered average load on all trips and zero slope
rate for all studied cities. Urban Buses are presented in three main
categories, which are Urban Buses Midi (\textless= 15 t), Standard (15 -
18 t), Articulated (\textgreater18 t), Urban Diesel Buses Hybrid, CNG
(Compressed Natural Gas) Buses. The speed dependent emissions factors
for diesel urban buses have been taken from HBEFA (Handbook Emission
Factors for Road Transport), for Euro I to Euro VI emissions standards.
Distinct parameters of EF were considered for Euro V standard, according
to the control technology, that can be Exhaust Gas Recirculation --- EGR
or Selective Catalytic Reduction --- SCR. According to EMEP/EEA, it is
estimated that 75\% of Euro V heavy-duty vehicles are equipped with SCR.
For the category of CNG buses, it has an additional emission standard
known as Enhanced Environmental Vehicles (EEV), since it may have
different combustion, after-treatment technology, and are associated
with lower PM and NOx emission rates compared with diesel buses (add
source). Only older CNG buses are classified in EURO I, II, or III.
Detailed aspects of hot exhaust emissions rates of Europe are found in
the EMEP/EEA guidebook.

\subsubsection{Emission estimates}

The estimates of hot exhaust emissions for each trip is given by

\begin{equation}
EH_{i,j,k,l} = L_i\times EF_{i,j,k,l}
\end{equation}

where \(EH_{i,j,k,l}\) is the emission for the street link \(i\),
vehicle category \(j\), fuel \(k\) and age \(l\); \(L_i\) is the length
of the street link \(i\)(km); \(EF_{i,j,k,l}\) is the emission factor
(g/km). In order to evaluate emissions spatially, the overall emissions
are allocated into a 350m resolution grid (H3 resolution from Uber).

\subsubsection{Emission post-processing}

Post-processing emissions are auxiliary functions used to analyze the
spatial and temporal patterns. These function are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{emis\_summary}: Aggregate emissions generated by the emis function by time,
vehicle type and segment link (spatial).
\item \texttt{emi\_to\_dt}: Convert emissions estimates from list to data.table format
\item \texttt{emis\_grid}: Aggregate emissions proportionally into grid cells through an intersection operation
\end{enumerate}

\section{São Paulo urban bus emissions using GTFS2emis model}

\subsection{Traffic data}

GTFS data of São Paulo city were retrivied in SPTRAN (São Paulo
Transportation Agency) and EMTU (Metropolitan Transportation Agency).
SPTRAN database includes all trips inside São Paulo territory while EMTU
database presents intercity level buses routes, where some of them runs
partially within SP. Considering the metropolitan scale of São Paulo
city, we considered all buses routes that crosses or is within the city
boundary.

The merged GTFS were filtered by route\_id and service's\_id, in order
to estimate only buses trips in only day (monday).

\begin{verbatim}
library(data.table)
library(magrittr)
gtfs_path <- "../../../Dropbox/IPEA/gtfs2gps/data-raw/gtfs/gtfs_spo_sptrans_2019-10.zip"

tmp_gtfs <- gtfs2gps::read_gtfs(gtfs_path)
tmp_gtfs <- gtfs2gps::filter_by_day(gtfs_data = tmp_gtfs, days = "monday")

# filter by bus route
temp_routeid <- tmp_gtfs$routes[route_type == 3,route_id]
temp_shapeids <- tmp_gtfs$trips[route_id %in% unique(temp_routeid),shape_id]
tmp_gtfs <- gtfs2gps::filter_by_shape_id(gtfs_data = tmp_gtfs,
                                         shape_ids = unique(temp_shapeids))

\subsection{Fleet data}

The data on fleet were obtained in SPTRANS and EMTU database. The
relevant information used to compute emissions were age, fuel, category,
and route in which buses uses to run. This last data were not available
for SP. The approach used to allocate buses per route was considering
the all the routes have the same distribution of vehicles, which is
based on fleet type frequency.

The figure below shows the fleet of São Paulo, according to fuel, age
and category.

\begin{verbatim}
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(data.table)
tmp_fleet <- readr::read_rds("../../../Dropbox/IPEA/gtfs2gps/data-raw/fleet/spo/bra_spo.rds")

tmp_fleet %>% 
  .[,lapply(.SD,sum),.SDcols = "fleet_composition",by = .(year,type_name_br)] %>% 
  .[order(year),] %>% 
  .[,type_name_br_lab := factor(x = type_name_br
                                ,levels = c("BUS_URBAN_D",
                                            "BUS_ARTIC_D",
                                            "BUS_MICRO_D")
                                ,labels = c("Standard", 
                                            "Articulated",
                                            "Micro"))] %>%

  labs(y = "Fleet composition (%)"
       , x = "Year"
       , fill = "Bus category") +

\subsection{Emission estimates}

Figure 1 shows the emissions of PM10 in the urban area of São Paulo,
with a spatial resolution of 350 m (Uber Hexagon 09). The higher values
of emissions indicates streets and intersections of high Vehicle
Traveled Kilometers (VTK). Intersections with high VTK are usually
interpreted as streets intersections or buses terminals.

Figure 2 shows the PM10 emissions distributed hourly. Higher values of
emissions on morning and afternoon peak indicates higher frequency of
buses. It can be also associated with average lower speeds.

\section{Results and discussion}

\section{Conclusions}

\conclusions[Discussions and Conclusions]

Given the wide use of GTFS to perform transportation analysis worldwide,
the package \texttt{gtfs2emis} can promote easier estimates of tailpipe
emissions. Detailed input data can improve the quality of estimates.

\section{Figures and tables in appendices}

Regarding figures and tables in appendices, the following two options
are possible depending on your general handling of figures and tables in
the manuscript environment:

\subsection{Option 1}

If you sorted all figures and tables into the sections of the text,
please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the
respective appendix sections. They will be correctly named
automatically.

\subsection{Option 2}

If you put all figures after the reference list, please insert appendix
tables and figures after the normal tables and figures.

To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following
commands in front of them: \texttt{\textbackslash{}appendixfigures}
needs to be added in front of appendix figures
\texttt{\textbackslash{}appendixtables} needs to be added in front of
appendix tables

Please add \texttt{\textbackslash{}clearpage} between each table and/or
figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.
