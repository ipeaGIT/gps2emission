\arguments{
\item{vel}{Units; Speed in [km/h]}

\item{veh_type}{Character; Bus type, classified in "Urban Buses Midi <=15 t", "Urban Buses Standard 15 - 18 t", 
"Urban Buses Articulated >18 t", "Coaches Standard <=18 t"       
"Coaches Articulated >18 t", "Urban CNG Buses", "Urban Biodiesel Buses"}

\item{veh}{Numeric; Distribution of vehicle type, required only when aggregate == TRUE.}

\item{fuel}{Character; Fuel type, classified in "Diesel", "CNG"  and "Biodiesel"}

\item{aggregate}{Logical; does the emission factor should be aggregated? Default is TRUE.}

\item{euro}{Character; Euro period of vehicle, classified in "Conventional", "I", "II", "Euro III", 
"IV", "V", "VI" and "EEV"}

\item{tech}{Character; Technology, classified in "SCR", "EGR" and "DPF+SCR"}

\item{pol}{Character; Pollutant, classified in "CO", "NOx", "VOC", "PM", "FC" (Fuel Consumption), "CH4", "NH3" and "N2O"}

\item{slope}{Numeric; Slope gradient, classified in -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0.00, 0.02, 0.04 and 0.06.
Negative gradients means downhills and positive uphills. Default is 0.0.}

\item{load}{Numeric; Load ratio, classified in 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0. Default is 0.5.}

\item{k}{Numeric; constant value to adjust emission factors. Default is 1.0.}

\item{show.equation}{Logical; show.equation from EMEP/EEEA used? Default parameter is TRUE.}
