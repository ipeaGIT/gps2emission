\title{Add slope class into the transport model (LineString Simple Feature object)}
\usage{
slope_class_europe_emep(tp_model, heightfile, keep = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tp_model}{LineString Simple Feature; transport model output.}

\item{heightfile}{character or raster data; The raster file with height data, or its filepath.}

\item{keep}{A logical. Whether the columns related height and slope to the consecutive bus stops
should be kept or dropped (defaults to FALSE, which keeps only the slope classification).}
}
\value{
The transport model with slope information.
}
\description{
Based on the input height data, the function returns the slope class between two consecutive
bus stop positions of a LineString Simple Feature (transport model object).
The slope is given by the ratio between the height difference and
network distance from two consecutive public transport stops.
The function classifies the slope into one of the seven categories
available on the European Environmental Agency (EEA) database, which is -0.06,
-0.04,-0.02, 0.00, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.06. The classifications is described in
@details .
