\description{
Returns a vector or data.frame of emission factors for buses based on
estimates from the
\href{https://cetesb.sp.gov.br/veicular/}{Environment Company of Sao Paulo, Brazil (CETESB) 2017},
and obtained via vein package.
Estimates are expressed in units 'g/km'.

The percentage varies of biofuels varies by law.

These emission factors are not exactly the same as the report of CETESB.
\enumerate{
\item In this emission factors, there is also NO and NO2 based on split by published in the EMEP/EEA
air pollutant emission inventory guidebook.
\item Also, the emission factors were extended till 50 years of use, repeating the oldest value.
\item CNG emission factors were expanded to other pollutants by comparison of US.EPA-AP42 emission
factor: Section 1.4 Natural Gas Combustion.

In the previous versions I used the letter 'd' for deteriorated. I removed the letter 'd'
internally to not break older code.
If by mistake, the user inputs one of veh names from the old convention, they are internally
changed to the new convention: "SLT", "LT", "MT", "SHT","HT", "UB", "SUB", "COACH", "ARTIC",
"M_G_150", "M_G_150_500", "M_G_500", "M_FG_150", "M_FG_150_500", "M_FG_500", "M_FE_150",
"M_FE_150_500","M_FE_500",
If pollutant is "SO2", it needs 'sppm.' It is designed when 'veh' has length 1, if it has length
2 or more, it will show a warning
Emission factor for vehicles older than the reported by CETESB were filled as the moving average
of 2:
Range EF from PC and LCV otto: 2018 - 1982. EF for 1981 and older as moving average.
Range LCV diesel : 2018 - 2006. EF for 2005 and older as moving average.
Range Trucks and Buses: 2018 - 1998. EF for 1997 and older as moving average.
Range MC Gasoline: 2018 - 2003. EF for 2002 and older as moving average.
Range MC Flex 150-500cc and >500cc: 2018 - 2012. EF for 2011 and older as moving average.
Currently, 2020, there are not any system for recovery of fuel vapors in Brazil.
Hence, the FS takes into account the vapour that comes from the fuel tank inside the car and
released into the atmosphere when injecting new fuel. There are discussions about incrementing
implementing stage I and II and/or ORVR thesedays. The ef FS is calculated by transforming
g FC/km into (L/KM)*g/L with g/L 1.14 fgor gasoline and 0.37 for ethanol (CETESB, 2016). The
density considered is 0.75425 for gasoline and 0.809 for ethanol (t/m^3).
